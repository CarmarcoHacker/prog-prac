#Programming Practicals at Durham

These practicals are probably the most important part of learning to programming. Lectures are offered in support of the practicals, rather than the other way round as in most subjects. The course is based around the book 'Objects First in Java' and the [bluej](www.bluej.org) IDE.

Many of the practicals have code provided for you to work with, so to do the practical you will need to get access to this via github.
